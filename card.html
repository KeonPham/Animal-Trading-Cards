			<p> In appearance, the Siberian tiger is distinguished from other tiger subspecies by its muted orange coat accented by black stripes, its thick fur, and its size; it is considered by many experts to be the world’s largest tiger. Fewer than 600 Siberian tigers remain in the wild, while several hundred more are kept in zoos and nature parks worldwide.</p>
